    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <div>

    	<p>Between the <a href="https://yr.media/podcasts/adult-ish-podcast/" target="_blank">podcast</a> explosion and the <a href="https://yr.media/tech/asmr-changed-this-twitch-streamers-life/" target="_blank">ASMR</a> craze, audio is having a serious cultural moment, and our friends at YR Media are all about it. You can be too. Whether you're inspired by the YR Media <a href="https://yr.media/video/found-sounds-ep-1-latham-square/" target="_blank">Found Sounds</a> series or your own audio obsession, use this tutorial to create an app that captures, stores and plays sound. We can't wait to see what you make!</p>
      

      <p>Click "Connect Your App" below to start building your app!</p>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/soundLibrary.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>In this project you will create your own app to capture sounds from daily life and store them in your very own Sound Library on your mobile device.  Be it for the purpose of capturing soothing sounds like in ASMR to calm yourself at the end of a long day or for capturing cool natural rhythms to generate your own funky music, we invite you to take on this challenge merging technology and the sonic arts.</p>

    	</div>
    	<div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>

  		<p>As the sounds in your Sound Library need to be preserved even when you close the app, you will learn how to access the long-term data storage capability of your mobile device using the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB component of MIT App Inventor.  </p>
        
      </div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>The User Interface</h3>
        <p>The user interface has been created for you in the starter project.  Examine the components and their layout in the Viewer and also examine the component hierarchy and the naming in the Components tab.  Pay special attention to non-visible components.  Feel free to change the properties of the components to get the look and feel you want for your app.  For example, change the color and shape of the buttons.  However, as the coding section of the tutorial will make references to them, do not alter the names of the components.

        <h3>Introduction to TinyDB</h3>

        <p> The <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB component stores data locally on the user's mobile phone or tablet.  <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB can only be accessed by one user on a single device.  In other projects you will learn about <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB which allows multiple users to store, access and modify data in the Cloud.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction to TinyDB</h3>
        <p>You will use <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB to store sounds recorded by the user on the local device using the sound titles as tags.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/soundofDogBarking.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>Below are descriptions and images of the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB blocks that are available.</p>
        <p>The following block allows you to store a value in the local storage of your mobile device using a unique tag, very much like how you would assign a value to a uniquely named variable.  One important difference to note however is that while a variable can hold a value only until the app quits, a value stored in the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB will be available to the user the next time the app is run.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/TinyDBStoreValue.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>The following block allows you to retrieve a value stored in the local storage of your mobile device using its tag.  Note that if there is no such tag, by default an empty string is set to be returned, but you can choose to return some other value instead by replacing the empty string block.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/TinyDBGetValue.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>The following block will clear the content in the storage associated with a given tag.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/TinyDBClearTag.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>The following block will return a list of all tags stored in the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/TinyDBGetTags.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>The following block will clear the entire data store in the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/TinyDBClearAll.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>Here is some more advanced information you can read about <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB.</p>
        <div class="hintContainer">
            <button>More TinyDB Info</button>
            <div class="hint hideHint">
              
              <p>Each app has its own data store. There is only one data store per app. Even if you have multiple <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB components, they will use the same data store. To get the effect of separate stores, use different keys. You cannot use the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB to pass data between two different apps on the phone, although you can use the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB to share data between the different screens of a multi-screen app.</p>
              <p>When you are developing apps using the AI Companion, all the apps using that Companion will share the same <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB. That sharing will disappear once the apps are packaged and installed on the phone. During development you should be careful to clear the Companion app's data each time you start working on a new app in order to avoid tag name collisions.</p>

        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/soundlibrary/initializeVariable.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>In this project you will need several variables to keep track of the data you will store and process.  The first variable, <var>currentSoundTitle</var>, is used to store the title of the sound currently selected by the user and the second variable, <var>currentSound</var>, stores the pathname for the actual sound file itself.  The third variable, <var>soundTitleList</var>, is used to store the list containing the titles of all the sounds in the Sound Library.  Create and initialize these variables as shown.

<h3>About Youth Mobile Power</h3> 
    <div>
      <p>A lot of us spend all day on our phones, hooked on our favorite apps. We keep typing and swiping, even when we know the risks phones can pose to our attention, privacy, and even our safety.  But the computers in our pockets also create untapped opportunities for young people to learn, connect and transform our communities.</p>
      <p>That’s why MIT and YR Media teamed up to launch the Youth Mobile Power series. YR teens produce stories highlighting how young people use their phones in surprising and powerful ways. Meanwhile, the team at MIT is continually enhancing MIT App Inventor to make it possible for users like you to create apps like the ones featured in YR’s reporting.</p>
      <p>Essentially: get inspired by the story, get busy making your own app!</p>
