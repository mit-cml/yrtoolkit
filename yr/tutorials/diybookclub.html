    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Calling all book nerds (and culture critics of any type): our latest guide challenges you to make an app that collects and shares original reviews of your favorite -or most detested- books.</p>
      <p>We were once again inspired by our friends at <a href="http://yr.media/" target="_blank">YR Media</a>, who reported earlier this year on an intriguing subculture: young people on YouTube who make bootleg audiobooks, some with huge followings. Cool, right? But is it legal...? Check out <a href="https://yr.media/tech/young-people-are-now-using-youtube-for-audiobooks/"   target="_blank">YR’s story</a> to find out.</p>
      <p>And while you’re at it, create your very own mobile platform for reviews -yours and your friends'- so that next time you’re in the market for a book, you’ll know just which titles to pick...and which to skip.</p>

      <p>Click "Connect Your App" below to start building your app!</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
        <p>In this project, you will create an app that allows multiple users to write and read book reviews.  You will familiarize yourself with the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB component of MIT App Inventor, and learn how to store, access and modify data in the Cloud.</p>

        <p>Here is the Designer view of the User Interface and its corresponding list of Components.  Note that there is a <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span>HorizontalArrangement for the write and read buttons and there are several vertical arrangements where different components are embedded to facilitate hiding and showing.</p>
        <p>Also note that the "Read Reviews" button is actually a <span class="icon" alt="listPicker"></span>ListPicker from the User Interface tab of the Palette.  The interface where the reviews are displayed is a <span class="icon" alt="listView"></span>ListView from the User Interface tab of the Palette.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to CloudDB</h3>
        <p>For this project you will use <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB as your database to store the book titles and reviews entered by your users.   This <em>invisible</em> component can be found in the Storage tab of the Palette.  Grab and drop the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB component on your Screen1 to add it to your app's Components.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/storagepalette.png" alt="some_text">
      </div>
      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction to CloudDB</h3>
        <p>You may have previously used the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB component, which stores data locally on the user's mobile phone or tablet.  <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB can only be accessed by one user on a single device.  On the other hand <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB allows multiple users to store, access and modify data in the Cloud.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the blocks in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB  drawer.</p>

        <p>The following block allows you to store a value in <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB using a unique tag, very much like how you would assign a value to a uniquely named variable.  One important difference to note however is that while a variable can hold a value only until the app quits, a value stored in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB will be available to the user each time the app is run until the value is erased.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/callCloudDB1StoreValue.png" alt="some_text">

        <p>The following block is similar to the block above; however, this block allows you to add a value at the end of a list stored in <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB under a unique tag.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/callCloudDB1AppendValueToList.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>The following block allows you to retrieve a value stored in <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB using its tag.  If there is no such tag, you can choose to return some other value like the empty string or the empty list.  </p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/callCloudDB1GetValue.png" alt="some_text">

          <p>Note that the unlike the "get" call made to <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB, which returns a value (almost) instantaneously, the "get" call to <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB is a request made to the database and does <em>not</em> return a value instantaneously.  When the database finally retrieves the desired value stored under the given tag, it triggers a GotValue event.</p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whenCloudDB1GotValue.png" alt="some_text">

          <p>One of the most important blocks in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB drawer is the following block.  When data is changed in the Cloud database, <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB informs <strong><em>all</em></strong> the users of the app of this change so that changes can be made on local devices as needed.</p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whenCloudDB1DataChanged.png" alt="some_text">

          <p>The following block allows you to erase a tag and its current value.</p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/callCloudDB1ClearTag.png" alt="some_text">

      </div> 
      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction to CloudDB</h3>
        <p>In <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB, you will store book titles as "tags."  Each tag (i.e., book title) is linked to a list of reviews associated with that title.  The diagram below may help you visualize how this works.  When a user enters a review for a book title already in the database, <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB identifies the title as an existing tag.  Then, the new review is added to the list of existing reviews associated with the given tag (i.e. book title).</p>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Initialization</h3>
        <p>First, initialize the app screen by hiding the two vertical arrangements for writing and reading reviews.  You can find the <span class="control">Initialize</span> block in the Screen1 drawer.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whenscreeninitialize.png" alt="some_text">
      </div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Writing A Review</h3>
        <p>When the <strong>WriteReviewButton</strong> is clicked, reveal the first vertical arrangement containing the interface for writing reviews by making it visible.  The second vertical arrangement containing the interface for reading reviews should still be hidden.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whenwritereviewbuttonclick.png" alt="some_text">
      </div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Submitting A Review</h3>
        <p>When the user submits a book review, let the book title be the <strong>tag</strong> and the review text be the <strong>itemToAdd</strong> to the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB.  With this method you will make sure that all the reviews associated with a particular book title are grouped together.  When the <strong>SubmitReviewButton</strong> is clicked, clear and hide the interface for writing reviews.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whensubmitreviewbuttonclick.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>Note that in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB each book title (tag) has as its value a list that contains all the reviews for that title. New reviews are <em>appended</em> to the end of the list, rather than overwriting previous entries.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Reading Reviews</h3>
        <p>When the user presses the "Read Reviews" button (i.e. <strong>ReadReviewsListPicker</strong>), show the review reading interface contained in <strong>ReadReviewVerticalArrangement</strong> , and hide the review writing interface.  Also, send a request to the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB to get the list of tags stored. Each book title is a tag, so this will return a list of all the book titles in <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB that currently have reviews. You will display this list for the user so they can choose which book reviews to read.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whenreadreviewslistpickertouchdown.png" alt="some_text">
      </div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Reading Reviews</h3>
        <p>When the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB returns the <strong>TagList</strong> containing the book titles, assign these titles as the <strong>Elements</strong> of the <strong>ReadReviewsListPicker</strong>.  This assignment will list all previously entered book titles for the user.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whencloudDBtaglist.png" alt="some_text">
      </div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Reading Reviews</h3>
        <p>When the user picks a book title from the list picker, send a request to <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB to get all the reviews associated with that book title. </p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/whenreadreviewslistpickerafterpicking.png" alt="some_text">
      
        <p>Note that <span class="procedures">GetValue</span> is asking for a list of reviews, so the <strong>valueIfTagNotThere</strong> should be an empty list.</p>
      </div>

    

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Reading Reviews</h3>
        <p>The <span class="procedures">GetValue</span> action requests information from <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB. When <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB responds to the request, a <span class="control">GotValue</span> event is triggered. Remember that the tag is the book title. The value will be the list of reviews for that book title.</p>
        <p>When <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB returns the list of the reviews for the requested book title, display these in the <strong>ReviewsforaTitleList</strong>, which is a <span class="icon" alt="listView"></span>ListView object from the User Interface tab of the Palette.</p>

     <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Testing Your App</h3>
        <p>Because this app sends information to the cloud to be shared by multiple users, it is helpful to test it using at least two devices so you can check that each user is properly accessing the cloud and getting the data updates.</p>
        <p>Go to the "Build" menu at the  top of the screen and click on "App (provide QR code for .apk)".  This will start the process of building the app so it can be installed on any tablet.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/apkBuild.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>A QR code will appear in a pop-up window once the app is built.  This may take a few minutes.  When it appears, both you and your partner should scan it using your devices.  Follow the prompts to download and install the .apk on your tablets.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/diybookclub/apkBarcode.png" alt="some_text">
        
        <p>Make sure that each user of your app is able to write and submit a review and is able to read reviews submitted by other users of your app.  Please note that when you first use your app, the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB associated with your app will be empty. Also note that there might be a slight delay before the data entered into the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB is readable on your app.</p>
        
        <p>After testing, if you need to make adjustments to your code, you will need to uninstall the old .apk file from each tablet and do a new build, repeating the above procedure.</p>

<h3>About Youth Mobile Power</h3> 
    <div>
      <p>A lot of us spend all day on our phones, hooked on our favorite apps. We keep typing and swiping, even when we know the risks phones can pose to our attention, privacy, and even our safety.  But the computers in our pockets also create untapped opportunities for young people to learn, connect and transform our communities.</p>
      <p>That’s why MIT and YR Media teamed up to launch the Youth Mobile Power series. YR teens produce stories highlighting how young people use their phones in surprising and powerful ways. Meanwhile, the team at MIT is continually enhancing MIT App Inventor to make it possible for users like you to create apps like the ones featured in YR’s reporting.</p>
      <p>Essentially: get inspired by the story, get busy making your own app!</p>
