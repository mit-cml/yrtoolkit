# Setup

## Getting your own OpenAI API Key

For this project you will need to get your own OpenAI API key to use MIT App Inventor’s <strong>ChatBot</strong> component.  As of the writing of this tutorial, OpenAI allows users 13 years old and older to create their own OpenAI accounts and generate their own OpenAI API keys. For the first 3 months, you are given a $5 free credit which should get you quite a bit of exploration time. After 3 months, any unused portion of the credit expires. Once your free credit is gone, you will need to become a paying customer with a credit card.  Follow the steps below to create your OpenAI account and get your OpenAI API key.

Follow the steps below to create you OpenAI account and get your OpenAI API key.

1. Go to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">https://openai.com/ </a>
    
2. Click on the Sign up button on  the upper right

# ChatGPT Tutorial

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will build a simple app with MIT App Inventor that allows users to connect to ChatGPT, ask questions, and have a conversation.

The app will allow users to define a System Role first so that ChatGPT will respond according to the role assigned to it. For example, if the user defines the System Role as:

 <em><strong>“You are a kindergarten teacher explaining everything at the level of 4 year old children”</strong></em>

and then asks ChatGPT to “explain the Big Bang Theory,” the response will be matched to the understanding of a 4 year old.


![System Prompt](../images/chatBot/KindergartenTeacherSystemPrompt.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

![ChatGPT Response](../images/chatBot/BigBangExplained.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>



## The Graphical User Interface (GUI)

In this project you are given a GUI that is almost completed.

![Initial GUI Corrrespondence](../images/chatBot/Correspondence_InitialGUI.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

What do you think is the function of each component? Many of the components may be self-explanatory. However, <strong>ListView</strong> is where you will display the user’s conversation with ChatGPT.

Drag and drop a <strong>SpeechRecognizer</strong> component and then a <strong>TextToSpeech</strong> component from the <strong>Media</strong> drawer.

![Add SpeechRecognizer](../images/chatBot/AddSpeechRecognizer.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

![Add TextToSpeech](../images/chatBot/AddTextToSpeech.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

Then, from the <strong>Experimental</strong> drawer drag and drop a <strong>ChatBot</strong> component.

![Add ChatBot](../images/chatBot/AddChatBot.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

Your Viewer and Components panel now should look like this with three non-visible components added.

![Non-Visible Components](../images/chatBot/NonVisibleComponentsGUI.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Adding your OpenAI API Key

Now you are ready to copy paste your OpenAI API key you generated during the Setup phase into the <strong>ChatBot</strong> property <em>ApiKey</em>. Your key will be different than what you partially see below

![Api Key Property](../images/chatBot/ApiKeyProperty.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>


## Coding the GUI functionality (1)

Click on the Blocks button to go to the Blocks editor.

![Blocks Button](../images/chatBot/BlocksEditor.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

You will accomplish all the details of this ChatBot app with only 4 essential blocks of the <strong>ChatBot</strong> component.  So first pull these blocks and have them ready for deployment.  Can you guess what each block does?


![Essential ChatBot Blocks](../images/chatBot/ChatBotBlocksNeeded.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

Now you are ready to start.  Initialize a global variable <em><strong>chatList</strong></em> to an empty list. This is the variable that will hold the messages of the chat as list entries.

![Initialize chatList Variable](../images/chatBot/initializeglobalChatList.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Coding the GUI functionality (2)

Recall that when you use a chunk of code many times throughout your program it is best to “factor it out” — that is, define it as a procedure so you can simplify your code and make it more maintainable (i.e., if you need to edit something due to an error for example, you can fix it in one place instead of all over your program)

Create a procedure <em><strong>processMessage</strong></em> which takes two inputs: <em>speaker</em> and <em>text</em>.
The speaker will either be “AI” or “User” for a given instance of the conversation and the text will be the text of a given message. The procedure will form text that looks like

<em><strong>User</strong>: explain the Big Bang Theory</em>
 
by joining the speaker (“User”) to the text (“explain Big Bang Theory”) with a ": " (colon-space) in between. This new text will be added to the <em><strong>chatList</strong></em> and then the procedure will update the <strong>ListView</strong> with the newly added text. Note that the <strong>ListView</strong> will display the chat between the user and the AI in <em>reverse</em> order so it is easier to read with the most recent conversation always at the very top.

![Procedure processMessage](../images/chatBot/procedure_processMessage.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Coding the GUI functionality (3)

When the <strong>SystemRoleButton</strong> is clicked, assign the <strong>ChatBot</strong>’s <em>System</em> property to the role designated by the user in the <strong>SystemRoleTextBox</strong>. The first entry in the <em><strong>chatList</strong></em> should be an indication of the assigned system role. For example:

<em><strong>User</strong>: You are a kindergarten teacher explaining everything at the level of 4 year old children</em>

Once the system role has been assigned, clear the <strong>SystemRoleTextBox</strong> of any text and make invisible the <strong>VerticalArrangement</strong> that holds all the system role assignment components.

Note: Don't forget to include a space after "You are a" in the two join blocks.

![System Role Assignment](../images/chatBot/whenSystemRoleButtonClick.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Coding the GUI functionality (4)

When the user presses the <strong>TalkButton</strong>, the <strong>SpeechRecognizer</strong> should capture the user’s speech and send it to Google for analysis:

![When TalkButton Clicked](../images/chatBot/whenTalkButtonClick.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

When the text of the speech is received from Google, the app will create the next line in the chat. For example:

<em><strong>User</strong>: explain the Big Bang Theory</em>

Also include code to send this text to ChatGPT as a question:

![When SpeechRecognizer After Getting Text](../images/chatBot/whenSpeechRecognizerAfterGettingText.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Coding the GUI functionality (5)

When ChatGPT returns with a response, a new message should be added to the <strong>ListView</strong>, like:

<em><strong>AI</strong> : The Big Bang Theory is like a really big explosion that happened a really long time ago…</em>

And make the <strong>TextToSpeech</strong> component read this response out loud. 

![When ChatBot Got Response](../images/chatBot/whenChatBot1GotResponse.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Coding the GUI functionality (6)

Finally, when the user clicks <strong>ResetConversationButton</strong>, reset the conversation, set the variable <em><strong>chatList</strong></em> to an empty list, clear the <strong>ListView</strong>, and make visible the <strong>VerticalArrangement</strong> that hosts system role assigning components.

![When ResetConversationButton Clicked](../images/chatBot/whenResetConversationButtonClick.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Testing the app

Now test your app by scanning the QR Code generated via your AI2 Companion.  Give the system an interesting role and ask ChatGPT some questions.  For example:

<em><strong>User</strong>: You are a Shakespearean actor who answers every question in limerick</em>

<em><strong>User</strong>: Explain why the chicken crossed the road </em>

<!--Please note that unless you use your own OpenAI API key, the number of questions you can ask ChatGPT is limited.  This limit is approximately 10,000 tokens at the time of the writing of this tutorial, where a token is roughly a word, which includes ChatGPT's responses to you.-->

Congratulations! You just created a powerful app that will allow you to chat with ChatGPT at the touch of a button and access a reservoir of knowledge and wisdom. 

<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Always use common sense when evaluating ChatGPT’s responses and be aware that, like any computer system, ChatGPT may fail.
