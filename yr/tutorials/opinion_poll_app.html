    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <div>
      <p>From creating a <a href="https://yr.media/tech/social-media-polling-for-a-sense-of-self/" target="_blank">poll on Instagram</a> to dropping in your <a href="https://yr.media/interactive/are-you-ready-to-vote/" target="_blank">ballot</a>, the ability to vote comes with great responsibility (and can be a lot of fun). Use this guide to create a voting app that empowers others to exercise their voices, share their opinions, and display results. Weâ€™re so excited to see what you come up with!</p>

      <p>Click "Connect Your App" below to start building your app!</p>

      <div class="tutorialNavigationHeader"></div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this project you will create a simple polling app that will allow users to express their opinions on a topic and the results will be collected via the Cloud.  In the process you will also catch a glimpse of how to represent, process and visualize data in the MIT App Inventor coding environment. 
    </p>

        <h3>The User Interface</h3>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/DesignerView.png" alt="some_text">
  		<p>Above you can see the user interface (UI).  There is a section in the upper part of the screen that allows the poll administrators to reset the Cloud database where data will be collected. The rest of the UI is dedicated to non-admin users (voters) who will be taking the poll.  There is a label where a Yes/No poll question will be displayed.  There are two buttons (Yes/No) where the voters can indicate their choice.  The graph will be hidden from the voters until they have cast their vote but once a vote has been cast, they can view the graph that is dynamically updated as other voters also cast their votes.  The exact number of Yes/No votes will be displayed and their relative percentages will be shown in the form of horizontal bar graphs.</p>
  		<img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/ComponentsHierarchy.png" alt="some_text">
      <p>Study the UI and the component hierarchy which has already been created for you.  Feel free to change the look and feel of the interface (such as button shapes and colors); however do not change the names of the components because in the coding part of the tutorial there will be references made to these names.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>The User Interface</h3>
        <p>Here is another look showing the correspondence between the UI and the components hierarchy.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
          <h3>Test the UI</h3>
          <p>This may be a good time to test your app on the AI Companion or the Emulator (via the Connect menu) to make sure your layout fits well and looks good when running on an actual device.  If you need help please refer to to the "Connect your App" tab above.  Please note that some components, like the graphs, may not be visible yet due to their default settings.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to CloudDB</h3>
        <p>For this project you will use <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB as your database to store the Yes/No votes entered by the users of your app.   This <em>non-visible</em> component can be found in the Storage tab of the Palette.  This component has already been added to the user interface (UI) for you but in another project you would just need to grab and drop the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB component on your Screen1 to add it to your app's Components.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/storagepalette.png" alt="some_text">
      </div>
      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction to CloudDB</h3>
        <p>You may have previously used the <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB component, which stores data locally on the user's mobile phone or tablet.  <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB can only be accessed by one user on a single device.  On the other hand <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB allows multiple users to store, access and modify data in the Cloud.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the blocks in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB  drawer.</p>

        <p>The following block allows you to store a value in <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB using a unique tag, very much like how you would assign a value to a uniquely named variable.  One important difference to note however is that while a variable can hold a value only until the app quits, a value stored in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB will be available to the user each time the app is run until the value is erased or changed.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/callCloudDB1StoreValue.png" alt="some_text">

        <p>The following block is similar to the block above; however, this block allows you to add a value at the end of a list stored in <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB under a unique tag.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/callCloudDB1AppendValueToList.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>The following block allows you to retrieve a value stored in <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB using its tag.  If there is no such tag, you can choose to return some other value like the empty string or the empty list.  </p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/callCloudDB1GetValue.png" alt="some_text">

          <p>Note that unlike the "get" call made to <span class="icon" alt="tinyDB"></span>TinyDB, which returns a value (almost) instantaneously, the "get" call to <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB is a request made to the database and does <em>not</em> return a value instantaneously.  When the database finally retrieves the desired value stored under the given tag, it triggers a GotValue event.</p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/whenCloudDB1GotValue.png" alt="some_text">

          <p>One of the most important blocks in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB drawer is the following block.  When data is changed in the Cloud database, <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB informs <strong><em>all</em></strong> the users of the app of this change so that changes can be made on local devices as needed.</p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/whenCloudDB1DataChanged.png" alt="some_text">

          <p>The following block allows you to erase a tag and its current value.</p>
          <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/callCloudDB1ClearTag.png" alt="some_text">

      </div> 
      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction to CloudDB</h3>
        <p>You will use the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB as a database to collect and store the votes cast in the cloud.  You will create two tags in the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB, "YesVotes" and "NoVotes", and under each tag you will store a list of "Yes" and "No" votes cast by the polling app users.  The length of each list at any moment will give you the total count of Yes and No votes cast up until that time.  Below you can see a depiction of the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB at an instant in the voting and the corresponding UI at that moment.</p>

        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/initializeVariable.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>You will need to keep track of various variables in this project.  <var>yesCount</var> and <var>noCount</var>  will keep track of the number of Yes and No votes cast by those who are polled.  <var>yesPercentage</var> and <var>noPercentage</var> variables will keep track of the relative percentages of the Yes and No votes cast.  Initialize these variables to zero.

        <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Initializations</h3>
        <p>As you will need to initialize many variables and many components several times (such as when the poll administrator presses the Reset Database button), you will create a <strong>procedure</strong> to <em>modularize</em> this initialization process.  To do so, go to the Procedures drawer in the Built-in Blocks panel and edit the default name of the procedure block to "initialize".

          <p>Define the <strong>initialize</strong> procedure to:
          	<ul>
			<li>set the <strong>PollQuestionLabel</strong> to a Yes/No poll question you would like.  For example, "Should the minimum wage increase to $15?"</li>
			<li>enable the Yes and No buttons;</li>
			<li>set the <strong>ShowHideGraphButton</strong> text to "Show Graph";</li>
			<li>disable the <strong>ShowHideGraphButton</strong> (until the user casts a vote);</li>
			<li>hide the <strong>HorizontalArrangement2</strong> containing the bar graphs;</li>
			<li>initialize the variables <var>yesCount</var>, <var>noCount</var>, <var>yesPercentage</var>, <var>noPercentage</var> all to zero;</li>
			<li>set the <strong>YesBar</strong> and <strong>NoBar</strong> width percentages to zero;</li>

        <h3>Visual Display of Graphs</h3>
        <p>Here are some screenshots that show how the visual display of data, in the form of horizontal bar graphs, changes as votes are cast.  Study these screenshots so you get a feel for the graphical displays you will be creating.  Note that the leftmost bases of these graphs are used to display the actual number of Yes/No votes that are cast while the horizontal bar graphs display the relative percentage of the Yes/No votes.</p>

        <h3>Data Changed in CloudDB</h3>


        <p>
        	When the users of the polling app cast their votes, the information is sent to the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB (see your code above when <strong>YesButton</strong>, <strong>NoButton</strong> are clicked).  As soon as the database has changed, the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB will need to inform <strong><em>all</em></strong> users of the app to update the information on the local devices and update the graphs etc.  Here is a sequence of events which needs to happen when <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB data has changed:</p>
        		<ul style="padding-left: 1.2em;">
				<li>If the value returned by <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB is an empty list (which means that the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB is responding to a database reset initiated by the poll administrator) then call <strong>initialize</strong> procedure to reset everything.</li>
				<li>otherwise, </li>

        <h3>Build Your App</h3>
        <p>Because this app sends information to the cloud to be shared by multiple users, it is helpful to test it using at least two devices so you can check that each user is properly accessing the cloud and getting the data updates.</p>
        <p>Go to the "Build" menu at the  top of the screen and click on "App (provide QR code for .apk)".  This will start the process of building the app so it can be installed on any tablet.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/apkBuild.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>A QR code will appear in a pop-up window once the app is built.  This may take a few minutes.  When it appears, both you and your partner should scan it using your devices.  Follow the prompts to download and install the .apk on your tablets.</p>
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/opinion_poll_app/apkBarcode.png" alt="some_text">
        
        <p>After testing, if you need to make adjustments to your code, you will need to uninstall the old .apk file from each tablet and do a new build, repeating the above procedure.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Test your App!</h3>
        <p>You are done!  Test your app thoroughly using multiple devices.  
          <ul>
            <li>make sure that you can cast Yes and No votes;</li>
            <li>make sure that you can view the graphs after casting a vote;</li>
            <li>make sure that the graphs dynamically update as more and more votes are cast;</li>
            <li>make sure that the graphs correctly display the relative percentages of the Yes and No votes cast;</li>
            <li>make sure that an admin can correctly reset the database and this change promptly leads to a reset in the user interface.</li>
          </ul>
          When you are done testing your app, remember that you will need to revisit the code blocks for <strong>YesButton</strong> and <strong>NoButton</strong> and disable the buttons as shown after a vote is cast.  This will ensure that each user of your app can only cast a single vote in the opinion poll.  When you make the change, be sure to test your app again using multiple devices.

         <ul>
            <li>Make administrator access to Reset Database button be <em>password protected</em> so that arbitrary users cannot reset the database.  (You may wish to look at another YR Media tutorial titled <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/app-building-guides.html" target="_blank">"My To Do List"</a> to learn how to add password protection to your user interface.)</li>
      			<li>Create an interface in the password protected administrator section so that the admin can write a poll question to be broadcast to all users of the app taking the poll via the <span class="icon" alt="clouddb"></span>CloudDB.  This will allow the admin to generate and broadcast poll questions as needed instead of being limited to a single hard-coded poll question.</li>
      			<li>Create a version where there are multiple choices to select from, for example A, B, C, D and thus more bar graphs to display.  This version may be even more useful in a classroom setting for a teacher than the simple Yes/No version.</li>
      			<li>Make a version of the project where the bar graphs are vertical rather than horizontal.</li>

<h3>About Youth Mobile Power</h3> 
    <div>
      <p>A lot of us spend all day on our phones, hooked on our favorite apps. We keep typing and swiping, even when we know the risks phones can pose to our attention, privacy, and even our safety.  But the computers in our pockets also create untapped opportunities for young people to learn, connect and transform our communities.</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s why MIT and YR Media teamed up to launch the Youth Mobile Power series. YR teens produce stories highlighting how young people use their phones in surprising and powerful ways. Meanwhile, the team at MIT is continually enhancing MIT App Inventor to make it possible for users like you to create apps like the ones featured in YRâ€™s reporting.</p>
      <p>Essentially: get inspired by the story, get busy making your own app!</p>
