    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <div>
      <p>These days Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are all the craze, but have you ever wondered how in the world is it really possible to teach a machine to learn something, anything really, and become, well, artificially intelligent?  In this project, using the context of one of the simplest children's games, Rock-Paper-Scissors, you are challenged to create a program that allows the machine to observe and learn from its user's game choices and quickly become intelligent enough to repeatedly beat the user at the game.  Hard to believe?  Get ready to surprise yourself.</p>

      <p>Click "Connect Your App" below to start building your app or go directly to the Rock-Paper-Scissors with AI tutorial below.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Connect Your App</h3>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this project you will catch a glimpse into how is it possible to program a machine to learn from its experiences and make "informed" decisions exhibiting intelligence.  You will implement a Rock-Paper-Scissors game on your mobile device in which a user can play against the machine.  The machine will keep track of the choices of the user and if a pattern emerges in the sequence of choices made by the user, the machine will exploit this knowledge to beat the user. 
    </p>

                <button>Click here for the rules of the game</button>
                <div class="hint hideHint">
					It is a two-person game in which each player simultaneously reveal their choices using hand gestures as shown below.  The winner of a round is determined by the following  rules:
					<ul>
						<li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
						<li>Scissors beat Paper</li>
						<li>Paper beat Rock</li>
					</ul>

        <h3>The User Interface</h3>
        
  		<p>Here is what the User Interface (UI) looks like.  In the top row the scores are displayed.  Underneath that there are three buttons that let the user pick a choice: Rock, Paper or Scissors.  Next is the part where the user's and the computer's choices are displayed in words and with images. Then there is a label declaring the winner of a round of the game.  The last part displays what is called a "Markov Transition Matrix", named after the Russian mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov" target="_blank">Andrey Markov</a>, best known for his seminal work on probabilistic processes.  You do not need to worry about this matrix now.  Later in the tutorial you will learn the simple idea behind this 3X3 set of numbers.  Note that coloring of the rows of the Matrix match the colors of the buttons for Rock, Paper and Scissors.</p>

        <h3>The Components Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>The UI has already been created for you.  You can see below the UI components and their corresponding place in the component hierarchy.  Study this diagram and the naming scheme so that you will be able to follow the rest of the tutorial where you will give functionality to the components.

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Machine Learning using a Markov Process</h3>
        <p>Here is the basic idea behind how you will endow the machine an ability to learn from experience. The machine will keep track of the sequence choices that the user makes and record the frequency of consecutive user choices.  The matrix that holds this information is called a "Markov Transition Matrix". </p>
		<img  src="../images/rps_withAI/Markov_prev&next.png" style="width:100%" alt="some_text">
        <p>On the left side, the rows of the matrix denote the user's previous choice and, at the top, the columns denote the user's follow up choice.  The cells contain information about how frequently a particular sequence of consecutive choices were made. For example, in the Matrix shown above you can see that 7 times the user followed her choice of Rock with another choice of Rock, 13 times she followed her choice of Rock with Paper, 11 times she followed her choice of Paper with Scissors, 3 times she followed her choice of Scissors with another choice of Scissors, etc. </p>

          <p>Suppose the user played Rock first and then followed this with Paper (i.e. the consecutive choice sequence was Rock, Paper).  Then, the cell in the first row (Rock) and second column (Paper) needs to be incremented as shown from a zero to a one.</p>
          <img src="../images/rps_withAI/Markov2.png" style="width:75%" alt="some_text">

          <p>Suppose then the user followed her last choice of Paper with Scissors (i.e. the sequence of choices was Rock, Paper, Scissors) then the cell in the second row (Paper) and third column (Scissors) needs to be incremented as shown.</p>
          <img  src="../images/rps_withAI/Markov3.png" style="width:75%" alt="some_text">
          <p>You can think of the Matrix as a record of the game choices of the user studied in pairs:<br />
          	<ul>
			<li>User choices in order:<br /> Rock, Paper, Scissors</li>
			<li>First group the first two consecutive choices:<br /> (<strong>Rock, Paper</strong>), Scissors</li>

          <h3>Smart Choice Using the Markov Matrix</h3>
          <p>Now that you understand how the app will keep track of the user's choices, consider the following scheme on how the app can "intelligently" decide its own next choice.  Say this is the Markov Matrix at some point in the game:</p>
          <img  src="../images/rps_withAI/Markov4.png" style="width:75%" alt="some_text">
          <p>and the user's last choice was Scissors.  Then according to "historical" record, the machine knows that user followed Scissors 15 times with Rock, 8 times with Paper and only 3 times with Scissors.  So, it is most likely that the user will follow her last move of Scissors with Rock.  So, what is the smart thing for the machine to do?  To beat the most probable choice of Rock by the user, the machine will need to choose ...  *<strong>Paper</strong>*.  Aha!</p>	
          <p>These examples should give you a sense of how the machine tracks consecutive user choices and, based on existing patterns, makes "informed" decisions about how most likely it may be able to beat the user.</p>

          <p>Note: This is a subtle point but in case you are wondering why you did not simply initialize the list holding variables <var>choices</var> and  <var>beatingChoices</var> using the <var>ROCK</var>, <var>PAPER</var> and <var>SCISSORS</var> variables at the very beginning when you initialized all the other variables, the reason is that the <var>ROCK</var>, <var>PAPER</var> and <var>SCISSORS</var> variables needed to be initialized first prior to being used in defining other variables.</p>

Make sure that you choose the appropriate type of procedure block returning a result.</p>

			<p>Look at the last choice made by the user (<var>ROCK</var>, <var>PAPER</var>, <var>SCISSORS</var>: 1,2,3 respectively) and then with this as the row index, you need to examine the appropriate row of the Markov Matrix to decide which column has the entry with the highest frequency stored in it.

			<li>Create a button (perhaps instead of <strong>MarkovLabel</strong>) to show and hide the Markov Matrix information so that the decision process of the machine can be hidden from the user.</li>
			<li>What other Machine Learning schemes can you think of?  How would you implement these ideas?</li>

		<strong>Further Explorations</strong>
			<ul>
			<li>The Machine Learning algorithm you implemented in this project is an example of a "classical" Artificial Intelligence algorithm (i.e. "classical" as in the sense of  "not modern").  It is domain specific (i.e. only applies to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game) and it implements a particular strategy for the game.  Do some research about Neural Networks to learn about more modern approaches to Machine Learning.  Pay special attention to the "supervised" versus "unsupervised" approaches to Machine Learning.</li>
			<li>Watch the movie  <a href="https://youtu.be/8tq1C8spV_g" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a> which documents the amazing story of the Machine Learning algorithm <strong>AlphaGo</strong>, developed by Google's <strong>DeepMind</strong> team, that in 2016 managed to beat Lee Sedol, the world champion of the board game Go.  </li>
			<li>Do some research about <strong>AlphaGo Zero</strong>.  How is it different than and superior to <strong>AlphaGo</strong>?</li>

<h3>About Youth Mobile Power</h3> 
    <div>
    	
      <p>A lot of us spend all day on our phones, hooked on our favorite apps. We keep typing and swiping, even when we know the risks phones can pose to our attention, privacy, and even our safety.  But the computers in our pockets also create untapped opportunities for young people to learn, connect and transform our communities.</p>
      <p>That’s why MIT and YR Media teamed up to launch the Youth Mobile Power series. YR teens produce stories highlighting how young people use their phones in surprising and powerful ways. Meanwhile, the team at MIT is continually enhancing MIT App Inventor to make it possible for users like you to create apps like the ones featured in YR’s reporting.</p>
      <p>Essentially: get inspired by the story, get busy making your own app!</p>
