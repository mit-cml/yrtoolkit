# Setup

## Getting Your Own OpenAI API Key

For this project, you will need to get your own OpenAI API key to use MIT App Inventor’s <strong>ImageBot</strong> component.  Follow the steps below to create your OpenAI account and get your OpenAI API key.

<strong>Note</strong>: As of the writing of this tutorial, OpenAI allows users 13 years old and older to create their own OpenAI accounts and generate their own OpenAI API keys. For the first 3 months, you are given a $5 free credit which should get you quite a bit of exploration time. After 3 months, any unused portion of the credit expires. Once your free credit is gone, you will need to become a paying customer with a credit card.  


1. Go to <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">https://openai.com/ </a>
    
2. Click on the <strong>Sign up</strong> button on  the upper right

# ImageBot Tutorial

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will explore the <strong>ImageBot</strong> component of App Inventor, building  an app that allows users to create images using OpenAI’s DALL-E. Here is how it works:
* Choose an image resolution.
* <strong>Speak</strong> a prompt that goes to OpenAI.
* Click <strong>Create</strong>.
* Once OpenAI creates the image in the app, you can re-generate other images with the same prompt until you like the final result. 
* With the click of a button, <strong>Share</strong> the image with friends on social media or email it to yourself. 
* <strong>Reset</strong> the interface and start again!


![Finished app](../images/imageBot/FinishedApp.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>


## The User Interface (UI)

In this project, most of the User Interface (UI) has been created for you. Study the given components (most should be intuitive). The <strong>Spinner</strong> component may be unfamiliar to you — in this app, it provides a drop-down menu for users to select the desired resolution for the image to be generated.

Drag and drop the following non-visible components to your app: 
* <strong>Notifier</strong> (from <strong>User Interface</strong> components drawer)
* <strong>ImageBot</strong> (from <strong>Experimental</strong> components drawer)
* <strong>Sharing</strong> (from <strong>Social</strong> components drawer) 
* <strong>SpeechRecognizer</strong> (from <strong>Media</strong> components drawer) 

Your final GUI should look like the one below. (Note: you may need to scroll down to see all your components in the Viewer.)

![GUI Corrrespondence](../images/imageBot/GUICorrespondence.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>


## Adding Your OpenAI API Key

To use the DALL-E program, you will need an OpenAI API Key. (You generated the key in this tutorial’s Setup section above.) Copy & paste your key to the <em>ApiKey</em> property of your <strong>ImageBot</strong> component. (Your key will look different than the partial key shown below.)

![Api Key Property](../images/imageBot/ImageBotAPIKeyProperty.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>


## Coding the UI Functionality

Now you are ready to give functionality to all these components.  Click on the Blocks button to go to the Blocks editor.

![Blocks Button](../images/imageBot/BlocksEditor.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>


Start by initializing a global variable <strong><em>imageFileName</em></strong> which you will use to keep track of the image files created.  Initially, this variable should be assigned an empty string.

![Initialize imageFileName Variable](../images/imageBot/initializeglobalImageFileNameTo.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Getting Users' Prompt Input

Code an event block that allows users to speak their prompt into the app.  When users press the <strong>SpeakButton</strong>, the <strong>SpeechRecognizer</strong> must capture their utterance and turn it into text.

![When speakButton Click](../images/imageBot/WhenSpeakButtonClick.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

After the <strong>SpeechRecognizer</strong> returns with the text of the user's prompt, set the <strong>PromptTextBox</strong>’s text to this returned text.

![When SpeechRecognizer After Getting Text](../images/imageBot/WhenSpeechRecognizerAfterGettingText.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Selecting a Resolution

Next, users can choose a resolution (256, 512, or 1024) for the image.  The default is 256.

![Resolution Spinner](../images/imageBot/ResolutionSpinner.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

After a selection has been made using the <strong>ResolutionSpinner</strong>, the value selected must be set as the <em>Size</em> property of the <strong>ImageBot</strong> component.

![When Resolution Spinner After Selecting](../images/imageBot/WhenResolutionSpinnerAfterSelecting.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Generating an Image

Now you have all the info needed to generate an image. When users click the <strong>CreateButton</strong>, unless the <strong>PromptTextBox</strong> is empty, have the <strong>Notifier</strong> inform users that the generation process has started via a Progress Dialog message. Then send the entered prompt to OpenAI so that an image based on the description in the prompt can be generated.


![When CreateButton Click](../images/imageBot/WhenCreateButtonClick.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

When OpenAI returns with an image filename, cancel the <strong>Notifier</strong> and set the <strong>Canvas</strong> component’s <em>BackgroundImage</em> property to the image file. Also, set the global variable <strong><em>imageFileName</em></strong> to this filename returned by OpenAI. You will need this available when you code the <strong>when ShareButton.Click</strong> event.

![When ImageBot Image Created](../images/imageBot/WhenImageBotImageCreated.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

Once the image shows up on the Canvas, users can repeat the process until they generate an image they like.

## Sharing the Image

When users finish with image generation, the <strong>ShareButton</strong> allows users to access the social media apps available on their mobile devices and share with their friends. 

To prevent runtime errors (such as when users press the <strong>ShareButton</strong> before generating an image), you will need to make sure that the <strong><em>imageFileName</em></strong> is not an empty string. In the message sent on social media, be sure to include the prompt of the image generated along with the image.

![When ShareButton Click](../images/imageBot/WhenShareButtonClick.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Resetting

Finally, when users are done sharing their image, they may wish to get a clean slate and start the process again by generating a new image with a different prompt. So when users click the <strong>ResetButton</strong>, set the image resolution back to the default 256, clear the <strong>Canvas</strong> background image, clear the global variable <strong><em>imageFileName</em></strong> and clear the <strong>PromptTextBox</strong>.

![When ResetButton Click](../images/imageBot/WhenResetButtonClick.png){:.enlargeImage}
<p style="padding-bottom: 7px"></p>

## Testing the App

Now test your app by speaking a prompt, generating an image, sharing it on social media, and resetting the app. Try to break it by testing different possibilities of button presses. If any issues are found, revisit your code and make the necessary revisions.

Congratulations — you have just created a powerful app that can generate and share creative images from user prompts.


# Expand Your App

* Research artistic generative AI programs like DALL-E to catch a glimpse of how they are trained and how they operate.
* Create a version of your app in which users can save their favorite image in an image gallery.
* Create a UI that allows users to draw over generated images and share these.
* Create a program that uses ChatGPT to generate a story from user input and then uses DALL-E to generate the visuals that go with the story.
* Play a game where you separate the prompts from their generated images and see if people can guess which goes with which.
* Organize a visual arts competition (in your class, school, district) to see who can create the best images.
* What awesome ideas do you have?
