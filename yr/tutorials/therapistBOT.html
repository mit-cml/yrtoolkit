    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Sometimes we just need to talk through what we're feeling. Therapy helps, but not all of us can access or afford it. Can an app on your phone do the trick? Our friends at YR Media reported on apps that use artificial intelligence to power therapy bots in their news story <a href="https://yr.media/tech/could-your-next-therapist-be-your-phone/" target="_blank">Could Your Next Therapist Be Your Phone?</a> Use this guide to make one of your own.</p>

      <p>Click "Connect Your App" below to start building your app or go directly to the Therapist BOT tutorial below.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <!--<img src="../images/therapistBOT/therapistBOT.png" style="width:75%" alt="some_text">-->
        <img src="../images/therapistBOT/therapistwithofficedecor.png" style="width:100%" alt="some_text">
        <p>This project is a vastly simplified version of a famous program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">ELIZA</a> that was developed at MIT in the early 1960s by Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum" target="_blank">Joseph Weizenbaum</a>.  The BOT program engages in a "conversation" with the user, in which it mimics a <em>non-directive</em> style of psychotherapy.  In <em>non-directive</em> psychotherapy, originally developed in the 1940's by the American counseling psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers" target="_blank">Carl Rogers</a>, the therapist never engages in giving expert advice to the patient and never gives direction to the conversation, but through active listening and asking questions, allows the patient to gain insight into their predicament and find their own way to healing.</p>
    	        
        
        

    	</div>


    	<div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction: Example Chat</h3>
    	<p>Here is a possible sequence of exchanges that our Therapist BOT might have with the user:</p>

		<p><strong>BOT</strong>: Hello there! I hope you are well today.  What can I do for you?</p>

		<p><strong>USER</strong>: my father hates me</p>
		<p><strong>BOT</strong>: Why do you say that your father hates you</p>

		<p><strong>USER</strong>: he always favors my brother</p>
		<p><strong>BOT</strong>: You seem to think that he always favors your brother</p>

		<p><strong>USER</strong>: my mother and I are very close</p>
		<p><strong>BOT</strong>: Can you explain why your mother and you are very close</p>

		<p><strong>USER</strong>: she helps me with my school work</p>
		<p><strong>BOT</strong>: Please tell me more</p>

		<p><strong>USER</strong>: bye</p>
		<p><strong>BOT</strong>: Be well.  Have a nice day!</p>
	</div>

    
	<div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>Introduction: Response Linguistic Structure</h3>

        <p>When the user enters a statement, the BOT responds in one of two ways:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>With a randomly chosen <em>hedge</em> such as "Please tell me more"; or</li>
		<li>By changing some key words in the user's statement (such as "I" and "my" becoming "you" and "your") and appending this to a <em>qualifier</em> chosen randomly.  For example "I always loved my sister."  when person-changed with a <em>qualifier</em> becomes "Can you explain why you always loved your sister?"</li>
		</ol>

    <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>The User Interface 1</h3>
        
  		<p>Now you will build the User Interface (UI).  Here is what the final interface will look like.</p>
  		<img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/GUICorrespondence.png" alt="some_text">
      <p>To center everything horizontally in <strong>Screen1</strong>, change its <em>AlignHorizontal</em> property to "Center".</p>
      <img src="../images/therapistBOT/AlignHorizProperty.png"  style="width:50%" alt="some_text">
      <p>Also change its <em>ScreenOrientation</em> property to "Portrait" and click to check the <em>Scrollable</em> property.</p>

    </div>
     <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>The User Interface 2</h3>
  		<p>First, you will add the BOT image.</p>
      <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/GUICorrespondence.png" alt="some_text">
      <p>Drag and drop an <span class="icon" alt="image"></span> <strong>Image</strong> component (User Interface palette), rename the component as "TherapistBOTImage" and set the "therapistBOT.png" included in the starter file as its <em>Picture</em> property.  You may need to restrict the <em>Height</em> and the <em>Width</em> of the <span class="icon" alt="image"></span><strong>Image</strong> component to a small value like "75 pixels" to make sure the image fits.  You can also choose to upload your own image for the BOT.</p>

  	</div>


      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>The User Interface 3</h3>
        
      <p>Next, you will create the Therapy Log where the user comments and BOT responses will be recorded.</p>
      <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/GUICorrespondence.png" alt="some_text">
      <p>Drag and drop a <span class="icon" alt="textbox"></span><strong>TextBox</strong> component (User Interface palette) and rename the component “TherapistLogTextBox”.</p>

      <div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>The User Interface 4</h3>
        <p>Next, drag and drop a <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span><strong>HorizontalArrangement</strong> component (Layout palette) where the user response textbox and submit button will be placed.</p>
        <img  class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/HorizArrangementDragDrop.png"  alt="some_text">
        <p>Set the properties of this component as shown below</p>

      </div>


  		<div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3>The User Interface 5</h3>
        
  		<p>Finally, drag and drop a <span class="icon" alt="textbox"></span><strong>TextBox</strong> component (User Interface palette) and then a <span class="icon" alt="button"></span><strong>Button</strong> (User Interface palette) <em>into</em> the <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span><strong>HorizontalArrangement</strong>.  
        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/TextBoxButtonDragDrop.png" alt="some_text">

      <p>Rename the components as "UserTextBox" and "SubmitButton" respectively.</p>
      <p>Change the properties of the <span class="icon" alt="textbox"></span><strong>TextBox</strong> component as shown below.</p>
		<img src="../images/therapistBOT/UserTextBoxProperties.png" style="width:50%" alt="some_text">
      <p>Change the <em>Text</em> property of the <span class="icon" alt="button"></span><strong>Button</strong> component to "Submit".  Adjust its <em>Width</em>, <em>BackgroundColor</em> and <em>Shape</em> properties as you wish.</p>

			<li>"You seem to think that&nbsp&nbsp"</li>
			<li>"Can you explain why&nbsp&nbsp"</li>

      <p>As the qualifiers will precede a reply generated by the program, be sure to add spaces at the end of each text string in the qualifiers list.</p>

        <h3>Dictionary Data Structure</h3>
        	
        	<p>A dictionary in Computer Science is a data structure used to store key-value pairs much like a real-world dictionary where words and their definitions are stored.  Unlike in the real-world dictionary, the dictionary data structure used in Computer Science can hold arbitrary keys associated with arbitrary values.  These arbitrary keys and values can be pretty much anything: letters, words, multi-word strings, numbers, as well as mixed combinations of all these.</p>

        <h3><strong>replace all</strong> Block 1</h3>
        <p>In this programming project one of the most crucial tasks to accomplish will be to properly convert user's statements, replacing first-person pronouns to second-person pronouns etc.  This is in general a non-trivial programming task but luckily there is a <strong>replace all</strong> block which can help.</p>

        <p>This powerful text block needs a dictionary of replacements for its <var>mappings</var> input and a sentence as its <var>text</var> input (such as the text typed by the user).  You also need to select a preference order: the default <em>longest string first order</em> or <em>dictionary order</em>.
		</p>
		<img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/replaceallPLSFO.png" alt="some_text"><img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/replaceallPDO.png" alt="some_text">


    </div>


	<div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3><strong>replace all</strong> Block 2</h3>
        <p>To understand the effect of each of these order preferences, examine the cases below.  In the first case, the preferred order is <em>dictionary order</em></p>

        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/DoItIrself.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>In the sentence:</p>
        <p>"<font color="red">you</font> knew it <font color="red">you</font>rself"</p>
        <p>the word "<font color="red">you</font>rself" contains the string "<font color="red">you</font>" in it.</p>
        <p>Because “you” appears first in the dictionary to be replaced with "I", “yourself” becomes “Irself” and the resulting sentence is the meaningless: <br /><br />"<font color="red">I</font> knew it <font color="red">I</font>rself".<br /><br /> (color is used for emphasis)
	</p>


</div>

<div class="tutorialContentPage">
        <h3><strong>replace all</strong> Block 3</h3>

        <img class="enlargeImage" src="../images/therapistBOT/DoItmyself.png" alt="some_text">
        <p>However, if you choose the <em>longest string first order</em> , then the longer string "<font color="red">yourself</font>" is first replaced with "<font color="red">myself</font>" and then next the shorter string "<font color="blue">you</font>" is replaced with "<font color="blue">I</font>" leading to a meaningful replacement of<br /><br /> "<font color="blue">you</font> knew it <font color="red">yourself</font>" <br /><br />with<br /><br />"<font color="blue">I</font> knew it <font color="red">myself</font>". <br /><br />(color is used for emphasis)</p>

		<p>So, it is best to stick to the default <em>longest string first order</em>  which makes more sense in the current context.   That way, the longest key in the dictionary is first sought in the sentence and replaced if found, then the next longest key is sought and replaced if found, etc.</p>

		<p>Can you think of any context where the <em>dictionary order</em> would be preferable?</p>

      <li>Have the Therapist BOT make a disclaimer at the very start of the session so the user knows that it is <em>not</em> a certified healthcare professional.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Give the user the ability to terminate the therapy session by using a key word such as "Bye" and have the BOT respond to the user with something like "Be well.  Have a nice day!" before terminating the application.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Add more hedges and qualifiers, also adjusting their probabilities of being chosen.  Add more choices to the replacements dictionary such as the pair <br />"I am" : "you are". </li><br />
      <li>Deal with cases such as when the user says "you are a bad therapist" (second-person to first-person pronoun changes) and other cases not yet covered, including capitalizations, like "You yourself told me that".  Test the Therapist BOT in a variety of conversations to make sure that it is able to change persons correctly in its responses.</li><br />
      <li>You may have noticed that some words in the replacements dictionary may be contained in other words and may be replaced inappropriately.  For example the word “<font color="red">I</font>” is contained in the word “<font color="red">I</font>ncomplete” and when the replacements in the dictionary are done with “<font color="red">I</font>” becoming “<font color="red">you</font>”,  one would get the meaningless “<font color="red">you</font>ncomplete”.  You can avoid some of these by adding <em>spaces</em> to the strings in the replacements dictionary such as making the key : value pair  “I&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“ : “you&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“  (there is space character at the end of each word) so that “I” is processed only when used as a singleton word not as a letter that is part of other words.</li><br />
      <li>Have the Therapist BOT offer some empathetic responses when the user says something like "I am sad" or "My father passed away last year".</li>
      <br />
      <li>If the conversation gets too dark (some key flag words like "depressed" etc. used), have the Therapist BOT provide the user with some Mental Health help information and refer to a hotline etc.</li><br />
      <li>Give the Therapist BOT some memory of the conversation and have it refer to earlier topics discussed in the conversation such as "Earlier you mentioned that..."</li>
      <br />
      <li>As you work with the Therapist BOT you have created, you may find yourself getting frustrated and experience some negative feelings for the ambiguous nature of the BOT. "<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/the-uncanny-valley" target="_blank">Uncanny Valley</a>" is a term that comes from Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori which describes the negative reactions people have to human-like robots.  Do some research on this very interesting topic.</li>

<h3>About Youth Mobile Power</h3> 
    <div>
    	
      <p>A lot of us spend all day on our phones, hooked on our favorite apps. We keep typing and swiping, even when we know the risks phones can pose to our attention, privacy, and even our safety.  But the computers in our pockets also create untapped opportunities for young people to learn, connect and transform our communities.</p>
      <p>That’s why MIT and YR Media teamed up to launch the Youth Mobile Power series. YR teens produce stories highlighting how young people use their phones in surprising and powerful ways. Meanwhile, the team at MIT is continually enhancing MIT App Inventor to make it possible for users like you to create apps like the ones featured in YR’s reporting.</p>
      <p>Essentially: get inspired by the story, get busy making your own app!</p>
