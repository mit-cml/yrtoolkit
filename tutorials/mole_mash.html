    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      In Mole Mash your mole is constantly moving. It moves when you tap on it and it moves if you don't tap it quick enough! You get points when you tap the mole.

      For this game we will be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keeping count of the score</li>
      <li>Moving the mole to a random location</li>
      <li>Using the timer to tell the mole when to move</li>
    </ul>
 
    <p>
      Connect using the companion app so you can test this on your mobile device. If you don't know how to connect, <a href="howtos/companion-wifi.html" class="setup">click here</a>.

    <h4>1. Create the Score Variable</h4>
    <p>In computer science we use "variables" to keep track of values.</p>
    <p>The score is a value that we want to know at all times. We will create a global variable called <i>score</i> and set it equal to zero. This process is known as <b>initializing a variable.</b></p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/initializeScore.gif"></img>
    <p>We can now use the variable <i>score</i> anywhere in our code.<p>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>2. Increase the Score</h4>
    <p>The score increases when the player touches the mole.</p>
    <p>We will begin by dragging out the<b> when Mole.Touched </b> block.</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/whenMoleTouchedBlock.gif"></img><p></p>
    <p>Every time the mole is touched we want the global <i>score</i> to increase by one. We will be resetting the <i>score</i> variable to:</p>
    <p><b> (the current score + 1) </b></p>
    <p> To do this we will <b>get</b> the value of <i>score</i> and add one to it</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/scoreAlgorithm.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now we want to change the value of our variable <i>score</i> to the new score. We do so by <b>setting</b> the variable to (the current score + 1).</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/setScore.gif"></img>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>3. Update Score on the App</h4>
    <p>So far we've changed the value of the <i>score</i> variable but we can't see these changes on our app, so let's fix that!</p>
    <p>In our app the <i>ScoreLabel</i> component displays the score. We will change the text of the <i>ScoreLabel</i> by <b>setting</b> it everytime the user touches the mole.</p>
    <p>Begin by dragging out the set ScoreLabel.Text to into your blocks. 
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/dragSetScoreLabel.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>If the user has ten points then we want the ScoreLabel to show "Score: 10" How do we combine a piece of text with the value of the <i>score</i> variable?</p>
    <p>Use the <span class="text">join</span> block from the text compoments!</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/updateScoreCode.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>4. Test Your Code</h4>
    <p>So far, your code should look like this:</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/updateScoreCode.png"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Use your companion to test your code!</b> Does the score change when you tap the mole on your companion? If not, find the mistake in your code before moving on!</p>
    <p>Always test your code while you are working on it, it's an important step!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>4. Reset the Score</h4>
    <p>Now lets reset the score when the user presses the Reset Button<p>
    <p>Call the event when ResetButton.Click, and inside of it set the global score to zero.</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/resetButtonSetScore.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you test your app you'll notice that it seems as though the score does not reset when you press the reset button. This is because the score label has not been updated.<p>
    <p>To update the score label we will use the same lines of code that we used when we touched the mole. Instead of the same code repeated numerous times we can define a <b>procedure</b>. This makes your code easier to read.</p>
    <p>Start by defining a new procedure called update score</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/updateScoreProcedure1.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>Then drag in the blocks you created earlier for updating the score label.</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/updateScoreProcedure2.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now you can use this procedure whenever you want to update the score label:</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/callUpdateScore.gif"></img>
    <p></p>

  </div>

   <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>5. Move the Mole</h4>
    <p>Now that we have the score set up we can move the mole.</p>
    <p>To move the mole we will be setting the mole's x and y position to a random location on our canvas.</p>
    <p>The random location must be between zero and the canvas width (or height) minus the mole's width (or height). So we will take that and multiply it by a random fraction. </p>
    <p>This is what your code should look like to move the mole:</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/moveMoleCode.png"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>Make sure you understand what this code is doing before you move on.</p>
    <p>When you put this code within your When mole.touched does the mole move when you click on him?</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/moveMoleCodeInProcedure.png"></img>
    <p></p>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>6. Make a Procedure to Move the Mole</h4>
    <p>Once again we will be making a procedure, but this time to move the mole. </p>
    <p>Take the two lines of code you made in the previous step and put them in a new procedure named moveMole.</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/moveMoleProcedure.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>Don't forget to put your new procedure back into your code!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>7. Set up the Mole Timer</h4>
    <p>If you don't tap on the mole quick enough, it will move by itself!</p>
    <p>We do this by using the Mole Timer and calling our moveMole procedure once the time is up:</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/moleTimer.gif"></img>
    <p></p>
    <p>Can you explain why it was helpful to use a procedure for moving the mole?</p>
    <p><b>Test your code:</b> Does the mole move after a while if you don't tap on it?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tutorialContentPage">
    <h4>8. Vibrate on Touch!</h4>
    <p>Let's make a fun addition where the mole makes a noise and causes your phone to vibrate when you tap on him.</p>

    <p>Add the Noise.Vibrate block into your when mole.Touched block and set the time to 100 milliseconds.</p>
    <img class="enlargeImage" src="images/mole_mash/vibrateOnTouch.gif"></img>
